These are all small problems I came across on range of platforms.

Starting my coding journey since 2017, school. Then in 2019 I got into competitive platforms: Hackerrank, codechef and Google kickstart.

In 2020 amidst the pandemic I got selected for the Google WTEF program, my coding journey went uphill from here, I enjoy coding and I am passionate about problem solving. 

Here you will find the starter and intermediate level programming problems with solutions.
